What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
One of the biggest challenges I ran into was deciding when to use aria-label versus aria-labelledby. It was confusing to figure out which one made more sense for a certain element. I worked through this by reviewing examples and using MDN documentation to better understand how each attribute should be applied. Another challenge was writing meaningful image descriptions. However, this was mostly my fault for choosing more complex images.

How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
To make the design responsive, I relied on media queries so that the layout could adjust smoothly across different screen sizes.

What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
MDN was definitely a life-saver, especially for understanding accessibility attributes.
